# Rogue

With Rogue, the SSR configuration will be nearly invisible to you. You don't need a special `/pages` directory (like Nextjs) or a separate `routes.js` file (like Afterjs). Only the `App.js` entry point you'd usually have. This means that you can wrap your app in layouts/transitions/providers, etc. the same way you would in a regular React Application, and staying true to React's values, you can organize your code however you like.

As an added benefit, Rogue also comes with first-class support for: GraphQL (Apollo), State Management (Redux), and Css-in-Js (Emotion / Styled-Components).

There are three Rogue packages:

- [`@roguejs/app`](https://github.com/alidcastano/rogue.js/tree/master/packages/rogue-app), holds the core modules for the Rogue framework. You can use this package to streamline your SSR experience independent of any build setup.
- [`@roguejs/hocs`](https://github.com/alidcastano/rogue.js/tree/master/packages/rogue-hocs), holds
higher order components that come preconfigured with SSR support for Rogue. You can use this package to enhance your application without uncessary SSR boilerplate.
- [`@roguejs/cli`](https://github.com/alidcastano/rogue.js/tree/master/packages/rogue-cli) (WIP), holds the build and development system for the Roguejs framework. You can use this package to power a Roguejs app with zero configuration.

*Note: If you'd like to get started with Rogue now, we recommend you use `@roguejs/app` with your own custom build setup. Check out the [with-razzle](https://github.com/alidcastano/rogue.js/tree/master/examples/with-razzle) directory for an example of how to setup Rogue.*

Each of the above packages holds its respective documentation inside its `README.md`.
